1. Pull image from somewhere, put it in the same directory as facerecognition.py
2. Run facerecognition.py with the image as an argument. This call should be multithreaded or async'd, since facerecognition.py takes about 2 seconds to run on my hardware
3. Upon completion, facerecognition.py will return a hash to STDOUT.

4. If the conversion fails, facerecognition.py will return -1 to STDOUT.
